This will be a hotel booking website. There will be three types of users Admin, Hotel Manager, and Users.

### Admin:

Only the website owner can use the admin account. Also, he can create as many as sub-admins to maintain the website. Admins can approve hotel onboarding requests.

### Hotel Account:

Any hotel wanting to become an onboarded partner will sign up here with the needed data. While an admin approves the hotel accounts, they can add room packages.

### User:

Anyone can visit room packages but only one can book a room with being a user. Users can book a room and watch the previous bookings.
